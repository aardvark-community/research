Selected papers, core compontents are built on:

 - The aardvark rendering engine is based on incremental evaluation and dynamic compilation for efficient execution of graphics commands. [An Incremental Rendering VM](https://aardvark-community.github.io/renderingvm/) gives an overview on this topic.
 - Aardvark applications typically use [FShade](https://fshade.org/). Some of the concepts have been published earlier in [CoSMo: Intent-based Composition of Shader Modules](https://aardvark-platform.github.io/lins/).
 - Although not the only option, scenes can be structured using scene graphs. For highly a highly composable, yet efficient scene graph system we use domain specific languages for [adaptive functional programming](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1186634) and scene graph definition. [Attribute Grammar for Efficient Scene Graph Rendering](https://aardvark-community.github.io/ag-for-scenegraphs/) shows and evaluates those conepcts.
